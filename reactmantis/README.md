# Mantis Place redesign
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Project is now being reworked for react and reactstrap.

## Done (Dec 4, 2020)
* Added shopping modal works (breakpoint added)
* Rewrote navbar to include bind method, as was taught*

## Issues
* Problems installing node-sass@4.14.1, and any version of it

## To Do (shorter term)
* Accordion (difficult to implement)
* Card is where the data will be stored beside the accordion sidebar nav
* Get sass working

## Longer Term
* Add React-Router
* Use SCSS for formatting
* Add React Redux much later
