# Mantis Place redesign
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Project is now being reworked for react and reactstrap.

## Done (Dec 21, 2020)
* Sidebar sub-links now render (due to hooks and mapping)

## To Fix
* Why does down arrow show up for all nav links results?

## To Do (shorter term)
* Dropdown arrow for links [and toggle as well]
* Toggle background buttons color [event listeners]

## Longer Term
* Add React-Router
* Add React Redux much later
