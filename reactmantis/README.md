# Mantis Place redesign
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Project is now being reworked for react and reactstrap.

## Done (Dec 6, 2020)
* State and props to get mantis data showing in body
* Sidebar Nav in progress [not functioning correctly yet; bind to event key?]

## Issues
* Fix: sidebar nav behavior (might take a while to learn)
* Fix: Images not showing up for mantises for some reason

## To Do (shorter term)
* Rewrite how mantis data is shown so that 4 cols to a row when rendering
* Make sidebar nav down-arrow toggle to up-arrow when clicked

## Longer Term
* Add React-Router
* Add React Redux much later
