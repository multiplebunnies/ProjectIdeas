# Mantis Place redesign
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Project is now being reworked for react and reactstrap.

## Done (Dec 24, 2020)
* Added more react-router
* Pages created for each mantis item clicked
* Designed the page that shows up for each mantis

## To Fix
* The design of the page for each individual mantis
* Write code for siebar nav links (making most default to home for now)

## To Do (shorter term)
* Added react-animations to items that show up on mantis page?
* Toggle dropdown arrow when clicking a sidebar link

## Longer Term
* Why is there a white space to the right?
* Add React Redux much later
