# Mantis Place redesign
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It was created in bootstrap and now being reworked for react and reactstrap.

## Done (Dec 3, 2020)
* Fixed reactstrap classes
* Added css styling
* Shopping modal works (breakpoint added)
* NOTE: Shopping bag is NOT yet a modal

## To Do (shorter term)
* Accordion (difficult to implement)
* Card is where the data will be stored beside the accordion sidebar nav
* Make shopping bag into a modal (without state just yet)

## Longer Term
* Add React-Router
* Add React-Redux
* Use SCSS for formatting
