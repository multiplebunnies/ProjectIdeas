# Mantis Place redesign
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Project is now being reworked for react and reactstrap.

## Done (Dec 27, 2020)
* Shopping Modal closes when you click "Continue Shopping"
* Fixed "flickering" issue due to extra "isOpen" in navbar

## To Fix
* Re-design of the page for each individual mantis
* Write code for siebar nav links (making most default to home for now) [easy to do]

## To Do (shorter term)
* Toggle dropdown arrow when clicking a sidebar link

## Longer Term
* Write logic for shopping cart
* Write logic for dropdown and results shown
* Add React Redux much later
* Why is there a white space to the right?
